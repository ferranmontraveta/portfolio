{"data":{"contentfulAbout":{"aboutMe":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"rawMarkdownBody":"# __Welcome! 👋__\nHello I'm Ferran!\nI was born in 1996 in Sabadell, a city close by Barcelona.\n\n# __Education 🎓__\nIn 2014 I started my BSc degree in Industrial Electrical Engineering and Automatic Control at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en). After finishing my bachelor's in 2018 I got accepted into the EIT Digital double MSc program. In September 2018 I moved to Finland to take the first year of the program at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). Nowadays, I live in Sweden where I am finishing the double degree at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en).\n\n# __Work Experience 💼__\nNevertheless, during my academic years I have tried to gather some work experience here and there.\n\n- __Feb 2018 - May 2018__ Joined [FICOSA ADAS](https://www.ficosa.com/products/adas/) for an internship position in Computer Vision.\n- __Jun 2018 - Aug 2018__ Continued at [FICOSA ADAS](https://www.ficosa.com/products/adas/) as a Software Product Engineer.\n- __May 2019 - July 2019__ Joined professor [Arno Solin](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/)'s research group in Machine Learning at Aalto University as a Summer Research Assistaint. \n\n\n# __Random Facts & Hobbies 😁__\nEver since I was a kid I have had the warm company of two main things, sports and music.\n\n#### 🎶 \nAs a kid I went to music school and took piano classes, and later on I taught myself to play the guitar.\n\n#### 🏃 \nIn general I love practicing sports, but track and field will always have a place in my heart. I started when I was still in primary school and, later on, when I was in high school, it turned out I was not so bad at it. I ended up having the chance to go to several spanish championships, scoring 4th of my age in long jump! ✌️\nRecently, I have gotten into rock climbing and bouldering.\n\nAll in all, if you are up for either a jam session or a climbing session around Stockholm, give me a call 🙂\n"}},"image":{"fluid":{"src":"//images.ctfassets.net/b6lrqzvm884p/3WQ9nMQxMcnq0a4lovB3dt/caaaae5f7e1980d12f7d348a988d264a/Awesome_trip_with_awesome_people_WeTotallySawAuroras...Drone_footage_by_thorgalle.jpg?w=800&q=50"}}}}}
